# EECS3311-Software-Design-Project
Our customer provided us with the following statement of their needs: The subject is to 
invoice orders. To invoice is to change the state of an order (to change it from the state 
“pending” to “invoiced”). On an order, we have one and one only reference to an ordered 
product of a certain quantity. The quantity can be different to other orders. The same 
reference can be ordered on several different orders. The state of the order will be changed
into “invoiced” if the ordered quantity is either less or equal to the quantity which is in 
stock according to the reference of the ordered product. You have to take into account new 
orders, cancellations of orders, and entries of quantities in the stock. A console based 
application for user input suffices.
